# electron-svelte-tailwindcss-starter

A very basic Electron starter implementing Svelte and TailwindCSS for reactive frontend with Rollup as module bundler.

Classified as "working work in progress", not yet "publish-ready". Aiming to bring it closer to the app-publish-point in future and create 
corresponding npm package when ready. 

### Installation

First download zip or clone, inside root directory run

```
npm install
```

```
npm run electron-dev
```

or one of the other npm scripts, see package.json.

Happy electron tailwind svelting! ðŸ˜Ž
